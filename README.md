# Design and Analysis of Algorithm Project

This project implements two algorithms in Python:

1. **Closest Pair of Points**
2. **Integer Multiplication using Karatsuba's Approach**

The goal of this project is to provide a practical implementation of these algorithms and offer an understanding of their behavior through both text-based results and visual simulations.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

### 1. `Q2.py` - Random Input Generator
This file is responsible for generating random input values for both the **Closest Pair of Points** and **Karatsuba's Integer Multiplication** algorithms. It ensures that the input data is randomly created and suitable for testing the algorithms.

### 2. `Q3.py` - Algorithm Implementations and File Generation
This file contains the actual implementations of the two algorithms:
- **Closest Pair of Points**: A computational geometry problem that finds the pair of points closest to each other from a set of points in a 2D plane.
- **Karatsuba's Integer Multiplication**: An efficient algorithm for multiplying large integers, which uses divide and conquer.

Additionally, `Q3.py` integrates the functionality from `Q2.py` to generate input data for testing and provides the main logic to execute and test both algorithms.

### 3. `Q4.py` - GUI and Visual Simulation
This file is divided into two parts:
- **Native GUI**: The graphical user interface (GUI) allows users to input data (either from files or manually) and solve the problems using the two algorithms. The results are displayed in an easy-to-understand format.
- **Simulation**: The simulation part visually demonstrates how each algorithm works. The simulation provides a step-by-step visual representation of the algorithm's execution to help users understand its process and performance.

## Installation and Setup

To use this project, follow these steps:
